## Contributing

You want to contribute to Pico? We really appreciate that! You can help make Pico better by [contributing code][PullRequests] or [reporting issues][Issues], but please take note of our [contribution guidelines][ContributionGuidelines]. In general you can contribute in three different areas:

1. Plugins & Themes: You're a plugin developer or theme designer? We love you folks! To get you started with creating a plugin or theme, check out Pico's [`DummyPlugin`][PicoDummyPlugin], and [Pico's default theme][PicoThemeGit]. If you have created a plugin or theme, please add it to our [Wiki][] and [Submit][] it to our website, where it'll be displayed on the official [plugin][OfficialPlugins] or [theme][OfficialThemes] pages!

2. Documentation: We always appreciate people improving our documentation. You can either improve the [inline user docs][EditInlineDocs] or the more extensive [user docs on our website][EditUserDocs]. You can also improve the [docs for plugin and theme developers][EditDevDocs]. Simply fork our website's Git repository from [{{ site.gh_pages_url }}][GitHubWebsite], change the Markdown files and open a [pull request][PullRequestsWebsite].

3. Pico's Core: The supreme discipline is to work on Pico's Core. Your contribution should help *every* Pico user to have a better experience with Pico. If this is the case, fork Pico from [{{ site.gh_project_url }}][GitHub] and open a [pull request][PullRequests]. We look forward to your contribution!

By contributing to Pico, you accept and agree to the *Developer Certificate of Origin* for your present and future contributions submitted to Pico. Please refer to the ["Developer Certificate of Origin" section in our `CONTRIBUTING.md`][ContributionGuidelinesDCO].
