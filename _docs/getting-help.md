## Getting Help

### Getting Help as a user

If you want to get started using Pico, please refer to the [user docs][HelpUserDocs] (you're reading them right now!). Please read the [upgrade notes][HelpUpgrade] if you want to upgrade from Pico 1.0 to Pico 2.0.

### Getting Help as a developer

If you're a developer, please refer to the ["Contributing" section][HelpDevContribute] below and our [contribution guidelines][ContributionGuidelines]. To get you started with creating a plugin or theme, please read the [developer docs on our website][HelpDevDocs].

### You still need help or experience a problem with Pico?

When the docs can't answer your question, you can get help by joining us on [#picocms on Libera.Chat][LiberaChat] ([logs][LiberaChatLogs]). When you're experiencing problems with Pico, please don't hesitate to create a new [Issue][Issues] on GitHub. Concerning problems with plugins or themes, please refer to the website of the developer of this plugin or theme.

**Before creating a new Issue,** please make sure the problem wasn't reported yet using [GitHubs search engine][IssuesSearch]. Please describe your issue as clear as possible and always include the *Pico version* you're using. Provided that you're using *plugins*, include a list of them too. We need information about the *actual and expected behavior*, the *steps to reproduce* the problem, and what steps you have taken to resolve the problem by yourself (i.e. *your own troubleshooting*).
