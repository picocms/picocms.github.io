Development of Pico has stopped a very long time ago. **We strongly advise against using Pico for new websites.** You can keep using Pico for existing websites though, it has **no known security issues**. However, please note that you will ultimately run into issues, because Pico wasn't designed for modern PHP versions. You can try the last [`v3.0.0-alpha.2` release](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.2), or use the [`pico-3.0` branch](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/tree/pico-3.0). They are as stable as the last "stable" releases, but just didn't make it through the release process before development was abandoned.

If you're about to create a new website and want to use a flat file CMS, check out some of Pico's amazing alternatives, like [Grav CMS](https://getgrav.org/), [HTMLy](https://www.htmly.com/), [Automad](https://automad.org/), or [Typemill](https://typemill.net/).

If you're interested in taking over Pico's development, please don't hesitate to contact us by creating a [new Issue](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/issues/new) on GitHub. Please provide some *brief* information about the extent of your commitment, your motivation, and your experience with Pico, PHP programming, and Open Source Software development in general. We're happy to help you take over the baton, but unfortunately are no longer able to maintain this project.
