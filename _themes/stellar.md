Stellar theme from HTML5 UP!, ported to Pico.

Stellar, is "a slick little one-pager with a super vibrant color palette".

This Pico port includes several pre-configured section layouts, and attempts to surface as much functionality of the original template as possible, *without* requiring any extra coding from the user.
