*The Letter is a depricated, but still working theme that could use some love. It has been archived by its original author.*

The Letter is a simple responsive blog theme for Pico. It was made for a fast blog with multiple contributors. The idea behind it is simple: two or more people (the authors) write a bunch of letters to each others.
