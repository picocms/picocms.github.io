Pico CMS theme based on the Skeleton boilerplate.  Comes in a regular and a 1280px wide version.

It is essentially the default Pico theme with Skeleton grafted on and the redudant CSS and markup pared away. Skeleton styles were generally kept instead of Pico ones, but then if you're using a minimal boilerplate like Skeleton, you're probably going to change the default styles anyway.
