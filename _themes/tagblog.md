This blog-like theme is centered around a tag list/cloud - other means of navigation, apart from a manually built menu, have not been considered (although posts can be listed by authors, too).

It is minimal and privacy respecting - no javascript, no 3rd-party resources, simple yet functional CSS design without animations or rounded corners etc.

It is also a responsive theme, a.k.a. mobile friendly.

Colors can be customised through YAML config files. Some `color-*.yml` files are included.

It is - was - based on the [NotePaper](https://github.com/mayamcdougall/NotePaper) theme, but has been largely rewritten to focus on the one aspect that was most important to me. I believe that tagblog runs lighter than the original NotePaper.  
Both the original NotePaper and TagBlog are licensed GPL3.

It also includes a modified version of the [mcb_TableOfContent](https://github.com/mcbSolutions/Pico-Plugins/tree/master/mcb_TableOfContent) plugin, which comes with its own separate MIT License, which I have included inthis repo (I hope that was the correct thing to do).  
Also see the separate README.md and README-tagblog.md in res/TableOfContents.
